				<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
				<p>Latest Update: September 2018

Adecco Group AG, Bellerivestrasse 30, 8008 Zürich, Switzerland (“Adecco”, “we” or “us”) is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.

This Policy (together with other documents referred to herein) describes what personal information we collect from you and how we process your personal information.</p>

			<h3>Personal information we may collect from you</h3>
			<ul>

				<li>We will collect any information you provide to us when you use our contact forms (for example “Application form”) like name, phone number, email address, country and your resume or CV. The provision of your personal information via our contact forms is not a statutory or contractual requirement; however, please note that fields marked with an asterisk (*) are mandatory fields, because we need this information to comply with or respond to your request.</li>
				<li>Other information or personal information you share with us when completing our contact forms or attaching documents is in your sole discretion.</li>
				<li>In some cases, we will also collect ‘sensitive personal information’ (This is information that gets special protection under our privacy laws. It is information about your race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health, genetic or biometric details, sex life and details of any criminal convictions or similar you may be subject to) where we are permitted to do so by law (so in some countries we will ask you about your background for equal opportunities monitoring). Where you choose to give us so called ‘sensitive personal information’, by giving us that information, you agree that we may use it in the way set out in this Privacy Information Statement.</li>
				<li>If you contact us, we will keep a record of that correspondence.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>How we use your information</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>To provide you with the services you expect us to, like participating in the Davis Cup work experience according to terms and conditions stated in the site;</li>
				<li>To find you suitable jobs/assignments to apply for, helping you with training, or facilitating the process of applying for jobs/assignments. This includes sending your CV to prospective employers for their consideration and keeping you informed of future work opportunities by email, telephone, mail and/or other communication methods;</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Do you have to give us the personal information we ask for?</h3>
			<p>You are not obliged to provide your personal information to us, but it is more or less impossible for us to work with you and provide our services if you do not.</p>

			<h3>Do we process information about you without any human intervention at all?</h3>
			<p>Yes we do at times. Adecco may use automated systems/processes and automated decision-making (like profiling) to provide you, and our clients, with the services you request from us. For example, when our clients are looking for candidates for jobs, we may conduct a search of our lists of candidates using automated criteria which takes into account your availability, skillset, pay rate and in some circumstances previous feedback we have received from clients to compile a shortlist which ranks which candidates are most likely to fulfil the client’s requirement. This means that sometimes your position in the rank may be higher than others, depending on how these factors match the clients needs.</p>

			<h3>Sharing with third parties</h3>
			<p>To facilitate our efficient use of your information, and to provide you with the content and/or resources, we disclose your information to third parties. However, this disclosure will only occur in the following circumstances:

To suppliers, contractors and agents. From time to time we may engage or employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. We may, for example, engage a supplier to carry out administrative and operational work in support of our relationship with you. The supplier(s) will be subject to contractual and other legal obligations to preserve the confidentiality of your data and to respect your privacy, and will only have access to the data they need to perform their functions; the relevant suppliers are typically IT suppliers (who host or support our IT systems, including information about you), premises management companies (who look after physical security at our buildings, and therefore may need to know about you to allow access to our buildings) and back office finance and accounting management providers (who might need to handle details of candidates in order to process accounts payable and receivable). We may also engage suppliers who provide IT technology services and solutions, which might include video interview and skills assessment tools;</p>

<h3>IP addresses and cookies</h3>
<p>We collect information about your computer, including (where available) your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration. This is statistical data about our users’ browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify you or any individual. For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on your device.

Cookies help us to improve the Website and to deliver a better and more personalised content. For more information about our use of cookies on the Website, please refer to our Cookie Policy.

If your computer is shared with other people, we advise that you do not select the ‘remember my details’ option when that option is offered by the Website.</p>

<h3>Do we transfer your data outside of Switzerland?</h3>
<p>Your personal information can be transferred and processed in one or more other countries outside of Switzerland. We shall only transfer your data outside Switzerland to countries which provide adequate level of data protection as defined by Swiss data protection law, or where the Adecco Group has put in place appropriate safeguards to seek to preserve the privacy of your information. Those countries include Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Demark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom.</p>


<h3>Data Security</h3>
<p>Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, you should be aware that the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to the Website or any third party; for this reason, any transmission is at your own risk. We will use strict operational procedures and adequate, technical and organizational security measures to prevent any unauthorised access, change, deletion or transmission of this personal information.</p>

<h3>Your rights. How you can access, correct and delete your personal information</h3>
<p>Under applicable data protection laws, you have the following rights:

Right to access and obtain a copy of your personal information: You are entitled to request confirmation whether we process any of your personal information. Where this is the case, you may have access to your personal information and to certain information about how it is processed. In some cases you can ask us to provide you with an electronic copy of your information.</p>

<h3>Marketing communications.</h3>
<p>We will only send marketing communications to you via email where you have consented that we may do so. We will usually offer you a check box on the forms we use to collect your personal information where, if you agree to receive marketing communications, you have to click the box. Where we send marketing communications to you via email, you may opt out of receiving any further marketing communications by clicking the ‘unsubscribe’ or ‘opt-out’ function in the email. In addition, you can also exercise your opt-out right at any time by contacting us at press.office@adecco.com and providing the following information: your name, your email address, a contact telephone number, the marketing communications you would like to opt out of receiving.</p>

<h3>Changes to this Policy</h3>
<p>The terms of this Policy may change from time to time. We shall publish any material changes to this Policy through appropriate notices either on this website or contacting you using other communication channels.</p>
